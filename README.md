SanrioBlock
========
SanrioBlock is a spin-off of CatBlock that displays Sanrio memes in place of ads. The code is basically the same as CatBlock with small changes in the UI and a new set of images :)) This was just a one day project, I wanted to learn more about Chrome extensions! I won't be publishing it on the Web Store since I won't be maintaining it and I don't have 5 bucks but feel free to download it and play with it as you wish <3
